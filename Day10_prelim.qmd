## Introduction to Comparing Estimators

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Overview**: Comparing estimates like means or proportions helps us understand differences between groups or changes over time.
- **Applications**: From socio-economic studies to political analyses, comparing estimators is pivotal in interpreting data.

## Comparing Means of Two Populations

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Context**: Compare the mean incomes of two ethnic groups using samples from each group.
- **Calculation**: $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ represent the sample means, where comparisons are made by analyzing the difference $\mu_y - \mu_x$.

:::

## Statistical Methodology

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Formula**: The difference in sample means is used as an estimator for the difference in population means.
- **Variance Consideration**: Compute sample variances $S_X^2$ and $S_Y^2$ to assess variability within each sample.

## Example: Political Preference Analysis

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Scenario**: Evaluate whether Republicans are gaining on Democrats by comparing the proportions of voters in two different polls.
- **Comparison Metric**: Look at the difference between the proportions voting for each party.

- **Insights**: These comparisons help identify significant trends or disparities, guiding strategic decisions and policy formulations.
- **Practical Application**: Enables researchers and analysts to make informed conclusions based on empirical data.

## Estimation of Difference Between Means{.font80}

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Estimator of Difference**:
  - $\hat{\Delta} = \bar{y} - \bar{x}$, where $\hat{\Delta}$ estimates $\mu_y - \mu_x$.

- **Estimated Variance of the Difference**:
  - $\hat{V}(\hat{\Delta}) = \frac{S_y^2}{n_1} + \frac{S_x^2}{n_2}$, assuming samples are independent.

- **Error Bound on Estimation** ($1-\alpha$ confidence level):
  - $B = t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, df} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\Delta})}$
  - Degrees of freedom (df): $df = \frac{\left(\frac{S_y^2}{n_1} + \frac{S_x^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{(S_y^2/n_1)^2}{n_1-1} + \frac{(S_x^2/n_2)^2}{n_2-1}}$

## Estimation of $p_1-p_2$ for Independent Samples{.font70}

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Estimator for Difference Between Two Proportions**:
  - $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$, estimates the difference between proportions from two independent samples.

- **Estimated Variance of the Difference**:
  - $\hat{V}(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}$
  - Ensures the variance captures the sampling variability of each proportion.

- **Bound on the Error of Estimation**:
  - $B = Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)}$
  - This bound helps gauge the confidence interval for the difference between the two proportions, facilitating decision making.

## Estimation of $p_1-p_2$ for Dependent Samples{.font70}

::: cle5
::: font80

- **Estimator for Difference Between Two Proportions**:
  - $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$, which estimates the difference between two correlated proportions.

- **Estimated Variance of the Difference**:
  - $\hat{V}(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n} + 2 \frac{\hat{p}_1 \hat{p}_2}{n}$
  - This variance calculation includes a term for the covariance between $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$, reflecting their dependence.

- **Bound on the Error of Estimation**:
  - $B = Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)}$
  - This bound provides a measure of uncertainty around the estimated difference, aiding in robust decision making under uncertainty.
