## Regression Estimator of $\mu_y$ {.font80}

::: cle6
- Discusses using regression estimation when there is evidence of a linear relationship between $y$ and $x$, without the restriction of passing through the origin.
- Essential for situations where the auxiliary variable $x$ provides valuable information for estimating the mean $\mu_y$.

:::

## Assumptions {.font80}

::: cle6
- Linear relationship modeled as:
$$
y_i = a + b x_i + \varepsilon_i
$$
- Where $\varepsilon_i$ represents random errors which we assume have a mean of zero and are independent of $x_i$.

:::

## Estimation without the Error Term {.font80}

::: cle6
- Ignoring the error, the predicted value of $y_i$:
$$
\hat{y}_i = \bar{y} + b (x_i - \bar{x})
$$
- Coefficient $b$, known as the slope of the regression line, is given by:
$$
b = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n [(y_i - \bar{y})(x_i - \bar{x})]}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

:::

## Regression Estimator for Population Mean $\mu_y$ {.font80}

::: cle6
- The regression estimator for the population mean is:
$$
\hat{\mu}_{y L} = \bar{y} + b(\mu_x - \bar{x})
$$
- This estimator adjusts the sample mean $\bar{y}$ for the deviation of the expected value of $x$ from its sample mean, scaled by the regression coefficient $b$.

:::

## Variance of the Regression Estimator {.font80}

::: cle6
- The variance of $\hat{\mu}_{y L}$ is estimated as:
$$
\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y L}) = \left(1 - \frac{n}{N}\right) \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\bar{y} + b (x_i - \bar{x})))^2}{n-2}\right)
$$

:::

## Error Bounds and Confidence Interval {.font80}

::: cle6
- The $(1-\alpha) \times 100\%$ bound on the error of estimation is calculated using:
$$
B = t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-2} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y L})}
$$
- Consequently, the confidence interval for $\hat{\mu}_{y L}$ is:
$$
\hat{\mu}_{y L} \pm B
$$
- This interval offers a range within which the true population mean is expected to lie with $(1-\alpha) \times 100\%$ confidence.

> Example 1: A mathematics achievement test was given to 486 students prior to their entering a certain college. From these students a simple random sample of tudents was selected and their progress in calculus observed. Final calculus grades were then reported, as given in the following table. It is known that $\mu_x=52$ for all 486 students taking the achievement test. Estimate $\mu_y$ for this population (estimator value, estimated variance, $95 \%$ bound on error, and $95 \%$ confidence interval).
