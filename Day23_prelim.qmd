## Difference Estimator of $\mu_y$ {.font80}

::: cle6


- The Difference Estimation method adjusts the sample mean $\bar{y}$ by a value dependent on the difference $(\mu_x - \bar{x})$.
- This method is akin to a special case of regression where the regression coefficient $b$ is set to 1, simplifying the estimation process.

:::

## Assumptions and Methodology {.font80}

::: cle6
- Assume a linear relationship without a slope component: $y = x + a$.
- Thus, any change in $x$ directly translates to a change in $y$: 
  $$
  \mu_y - \bar{y} = \mu_x - \bar{x}
  $$

:::

## Formulation of the Difference Estimator {.font80}

::: cle6
- The difference estimator for the population mean $\mu_y$ is:
  $$
  \hat{\mu}_{y D} = \bar{y} + (\mu_x - \bar{x}) = \mu_x + (\bar{y} - \bar{x})
  $$
- Here, $\bar{d} = \bar{y} - \bar{x}$ represents the average difference between the variables.

:::

## Variance of the Difference Estimator {.font80}

::: cle6
- The estimated variance of $\hat{\mu}_{y D}$ is given by:
  $$
  \hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y D}) = \left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - x_i - \bar{d}\right)^2}{(n-1)}
  $$
- This accounts for the sampling variability and the differences between the paired observations.

:::

## Error Bounds and Confidence Interval {.font80}

::: cle6
- $(1-\alpha) \times 100\%$ bound on the error of estimation:
  $$
  B = t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, (n-1)} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y D})}
  $$
- Confidence Interval for $\hat{\mu}_{y D}$:
  $$
  \hat{\mu}_{y D} \pm B
  $$
- This interval estimates where the true mean $\mu_y$ lies with $(1-\alpha) \times 100\%$ confidence.

> Example 1: Auditors are often interested in comparing the audited value of items with the bookvalue. Generally, book values are known for every item in the population, and auditvalues are obtained for a sample of these items. The book values can then be used toobtain a good estimate of the total or average audit value for the population. Suppose a population contains 180 inventory items with a stated book value of $\$ 13,320$. Let $x_i$ denote the book value and $y_i$ the audit value of the $i$ th item. A simple random sample of items yields the results shown in the following table. A plot of these data shows them to lie along a straight line through the origin, with a slope fairly close to 1 . Estimate the mean audit value of $\mu_y$ by the difference method for this population (estimator value, estimated variance, $95 \%$ bound on error, and $95 \%$ confidence interval).
