## Recap: Introduction to Ratio Estimation {.font80}

::: cle6


- **Population Ratio** ($R$), **Mean** ($\mu_y$), and **Total** ($\tau_y$) are estimated using ratio estimation.
- **Important Note**: While $\mu_y$ and $\tau_y$ estimates can assume a normal distribution for large samples due to the Central Limit Theorem, this is **not true for $R$**.

## Sample Size for Estimating $\mu_y$ and $\tau_y$ {.font80}

::: cle6

- The normal assumption facilitates determining the bound on error, $\boldsymbol{B}$, leading to the formula for required sample size.

Formula to Determine Sample Size:
$$
B = Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}}
$$

- Where:
  - $\hat{V}$ for $\mu_y$: $\left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right) \cdot \frac{\sigma_r^2}{n}$
  - $\hat{V}$ for $\tau_y$: $N^2 \left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right) \cdot \frac{\sigma_r^2}{n}$

:::

## Calculating Sample Size {.font80}

::: cle6

- Solving for $n$, we derive:
$$
n = \frac{N \cdot \sigma_r^2}{N \cdot D^2 + \sigma_r^2}
$$

- Where $D$ varies based on whether estimating $\mu_y$ or $\tau_y$:
  - For $\mu_y$: $D = \frac{B}{z}$
  - For $\tau_y$: $D = \frac{B}{N\cdot Z}$

:::

## Preliminary Studies {.font80}

::: cle6

- When $\sigma_r$ is unknown, conduct a preliminary study to estimate $\sigma_r^2$:

$$
S_r^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n^{\prime}} \left(y_i - r x_i\right)^2}{n^{\prime} - 1}
$$

> Example 1: An investigator wishes to estimate the average number of trees $\mu_y$ per acre on an $N=1000$ acre plantation. She plans to sample $n$ 1-acre plots and count the number of trees $y$ on each plot. She also has aerial photographs of the plantation from which she can estimate the number of trees $x$ on each plot for the entire plantation. Hence, she knows $\mu_x$ approximately. Therefore, to use a ratio estimator of $\mu_y$ seems appropriate. The investigator need to determine the sample size needed to estimate $\mu_y$ with a $95 \%$ bound on the error of estimation of $B=1.0$.
Since no prior information is available, she must conduct a preliminary study to estimate $\sigma_r^2$. A preliminary study of $n^{\prime}=10$ plots is conducted and the result is given as follows. Use the data to determine the size.

> Example 2: An auditor wishes to compare the actual dollar value of an inventory of a hospital, $\tau_y$, with the recorded inventory, $\tau_x$. The recorded inventory $\tau_x$ can be summarized from computer-stored hospital records. The actual inventory $\tau_y$ could be determined by examining and counting all the hospital supplies, but this process would be very time-consuming and costly. Hence, the auditor plans to estimate $\tau_y$ from a sample of $n$ different items randomly selected from the hospital's supplies.
Records in the computer list $N=2100$ different item types and the number of each particular item in the hospital inventory. With these data, a total value for each item, $x$, can be obtained by multiplying the total number of each recorded item by the unit value per item. The total dollar value of the inventory obtained from the computer, $\tau_x$, is found to be $\$ 45,000$. Determine the sample size (number of items) needed to estimate $\tau_y$ with a $95 \%$ bound on the error of estimation of magnitude $B=\$ 500$.
A preliminary study with 15 different items were conducted to estimate $\sigma_r^2$, and the results are given in the following table.
