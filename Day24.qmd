## Introduction to Estimators {.font80}

::: cle7
In survey sampling, different estimators provide various ways to estimate population parameters. Today, we will explore:

- Simple Random Sampling Estimator ($\bar{y}$)
- Ratio Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y}$)
- Regression Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y L}$)
- Difference Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y D}$)

Each estimator has unique properties and use cases.

## Understanding Bias in Estimators {.font80}

::: cle8
**Bias** refers to the difference between an estimator's expected value and the true value of the population parameter:

- **Simple Sampling ($\bar{y}$):** Always unbiased.
- **Ratio Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y}$):** Biased except under specific conditions.
- **Regression Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y L}$):** Biased for finite populations unless the data points are linear.
- **Difference Estimator ($\hat{\mu}_{y D}$):** Always unbiased.

**Key Note:** Bias affects how we interpret and trust our estimations.

## Relative Efficiency {.font80}

::: cle9
Relative Efficiency (RE) helps compare two estimators based on their variances under similar conditions:

- **Higher RE (>1)** means the first estimator is generally better (lower variance).
- **Lower RE (<1)** favors the second estimator.

$$
\text{RE}(T_1, T_2) = \frac{\hat{V}(T_2)}{\hat{V}(T_1)}
$$

RE is crucial when deciding which estimator provides the most reliable results.

## Estimator Performance Comparison {.font60}



| Estimator               | Estimated Mean      | Estimated Variance       | 95% CI                                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Random Sampling  | $\mu_{y}$           | $\hat{V}(\bar{y})$       | $\mu_{y} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, \text{df}} \sqrt{\hat{V}(\bar{y})}$ |
| Ratio Estimator         | $\hat{\mu}_{y}$     | $\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y})$ | $\hat{\mu}_{y} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, \text{df}} \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y})}$ |
| Regression Estimator    | $\hat{\mu}_{y L}$   | $\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y L})$ | $\hat{\mu}_{y L} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, \text{df}} \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y L})}$ |
| Difference Estimator    | $\hat{\mu}_{y D}$   | $\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y D})$ | $\hat{\mu}_{y D} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, \text{df}} \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{\mu}_{y D})}$ |

Each estimator uses the sample to provide different insights into the population's characteristics. 



## Visualizing Data Relationships {.font80}

::: cle15

**Plot Analysis:**

- A strong linear relationship suggests the use of a regression or ratio estimator.
- Non-linear relationships may require more complex models or the difference estimator for better accuracy.

:::

## Choosing the Right Estimator {.font80}

::: cle10

Deciding factors:

- **Linearity and Bias:** If data points are linear, regression and ratio estimators are effective.
- **Relative Efficiency:** Higher RE indicates a more efficient estimator under given conditions.
- **Unbiased Nature:** Preference for unbiased estimators in settings where bias can't be controlled.

Practical examples and simulations help in understanding estimator performance.

## {.font40}

> Example 1 A mathematics achievement test was given to 486 students prior to their entering a certain college. From these students a simple random sample of $n=10$ students was selected and their progress in calculus observed. Final calculus grades were then reported, as given in the following table. It is known that $\mu_x=52$ for all 486 students taking the achievement test. Estimate $\mu_y$ for this population (estimator value, estimated variance, $95 \%$ bound on error, and $95 \%$ confidence interval). Use the simple random sampling estimator, ratio estimator, regression estimator, and difference estimator, and perform comparisons.
