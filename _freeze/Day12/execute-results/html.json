Each sampling unit must uniquely classify into one stratum.\n- **Classification Challenges:** For example, whether a town of 1000 inhabitants is 'urban' or 'rural' can depend on proximity to larger cities or isolation.\n- **Criteria Definition:** Essential to define terms like 'urban' and 'rural' to prevent classification ambiguity.\n\n:::\n\n## Step 2: Sampling Process and Notations {.font80}\n\n::: cle11\n\n- **Assigning Units:** Place each unit, e.g., household, into the appropriate stratum based on clear, predefined criteria.\n- **Sampling Notations:**\n  - **L:** Number of strata.\n  - **$N_i$:** Number of sampling units in stratum $i$.\n  - **$N$:** Total population size, $N = N_1 + N_2 + \\cdots + N_L$.\n\n\n:::\n\n## Step 3: Sample Selection and Independence {.font80}\n\n<br>\n\n::: cle10\n- **Independent Sampling:** Ensure that the sample from each stratum is chosen independently using different random sampling methods.\n- **Choosing Sample Sizes:** Appropriate number of samples from each stratum and ensuring selections from different strata do not influence each other will be covered later.\n\n:::\n\n## {.font60}\n\n> Example 1: An advertising agency wants to understand how much focus to give to TV advertising in a specific county. To do this, they plan to survey how many hours households watch TV each week. The county includes two towns-Town A, centered around a factory with many families having schoolage children, and Town B, a wealthier suburb with older residents and fewer children-and a rural area. The numbers of households are 155 in Town A, 62 in Town B, and 93 in the rural area. Analyze the advantages of using stratified random sampling in this scenario.\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n## {.font60}\n\n> Exampe 2: A corporation is evaluating the effectiveness of a new business machine by gathering ratings from its division heads across three regions: North America, Europe, and Asia. To ensure that the ratings are representative and to manage costs effectively, stratified sampling is chosen as the method. The costs of conducting interviews vary by region, and so do the variances in the ratings obtained. The company aims to estimate the average effectiveness rating of the machine with a desired variance in the estimate of $V\\left(\\bar{y}_{\\text {st }}\\right)=0.1$. Determine the optimal sample size $n$ that achieves the variance bound of $V\\left(\\bar{y}_{\\text {st }}\\right)=0.1$ and calculate the appropriate allocation of the sample size across the strata based on the Neyman allocation principle, which considers both the stratum variances and the costs associated with sampling each stratum. The following table provides the costs per interview, the variances of the ratings, and the total number of division heads in each region. \n\n| Stratum | North America | Europe | Asia |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $c$ | $\\$ 9$ | $\\$ 25$ | $\\$ 36$ |\n| $\\sigma^2$ | 2.25 | 3.24 | 3.24 |\n| $N$ | 112 | 68 | 39 |\n\n\n##",
