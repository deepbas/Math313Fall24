Generate a random number $\\varepsilon$ from a uniform distribution over $(0, a)$.\n2. Select elements $i$ such that $i-1 < \\varepsilon + (j-1)a \\leq i$; for $j = 1, \\ldots, n$ and $i = 1, \\ldots, N$.\n\nThis method ensures each element has an equal chance of selection, regardless of the frame's total size relative to $n$.\n\n:::\n\n## {.font50}\n\n> Example 1: (Ex 7.3, Textbook) We are working with a retail store with four departments. Each department has charge accounts, and we want to estimate the proportion of past-due accounts using systematic sampling. The key questions involve listing systematic samples and computing exact variances, followed by comparing these results with simple random sampling variances.\n\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n|                 | Department 1 | Department 2 | Department 3   | Department 4   |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Account numbers** | 1-11        | 12-20       | 21-28         | 29-40         |\n| **Delinquent accounts** | 1, 2, 3, 4 | 12, 13, 14 | 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 | 29, 30, 31, 32 |\n\n\nThe store wishes to estimate the proportion of past-due accounts using systematic sampling.\n\nPart (a): 1-in-10 Systematic Samples\n\nList all possible 1-in-10 systematic samples and compute the exact variance of the sample proportion.\n\n\n\n\n## {.font50}\n\nPart (b): 1-in-5 Systematic Samples\n\nNext, list all possible 1-in-5 systematic samples and compute the exact variance of the sample proportion.\n\n\n\n## {.font50}\n\nPart (c): Comparing Systematic Sampling with Simple Random Sampling\n\nWe will now compare the variances obtained in parts (a) and (b) with simple random sampling of sizes $n=4$ and $n=8$.\n\n\n",
