## Introduction to Stratified Sampling {.font80}

<br>

::: cle15

- **Overview:** In stratified sampling, the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups, and samples are taken from each.
- **Key Concept:** Unlike simple random sampling with one total sample size $n$, stratified sampling requires determining $L+1$ sample sizes: $n$, the total sample size, and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L$, the sample size for each stratum.


:::

## Objective of Sample Allocation {.font80}

::: cle13
- **Objective:** Minimize the variance of the estimator at the lowest possible cost.
- **Factors Influencing Allocation:**
  1. Number of elements in each stratum, $N_i$.
  2. Variability within each stratum, $\sigma_i$.
  3. Cost of sampling from each stratum, $c_i$.
:::

## Allocation Formulas {.font70}


::: cle6
- **Neyman Allocation (Equal Costs):**
  $$
  w_i=\frac{N_i \sigma_i}{\sum_{j=1}^L N_j \sigma_j}
  $$
- **Proportional Allocation (Equal Costs and Variability):**
  $$
  w_i=\frac{N_i}{N}
  $$
- **General Allocation (Varying Costs and Variability):**
  $$
  w_i=\frac{\frac{N_i \sigma_i}{\sqrt{c_i}}}{\sum_{k=1}^L \frac{N_k \sigma_k}{\sqrt{c_k}}}
  $$
:::

## Sample Size Determination {.font80}

::: cle12
- **Estimation of Mean/Average or Total:**
  $$
  n=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^L N_i^2 \frac{\sigma_i^2}{w_i}}{N^2 D^2 + \sum_{i=1}^L N_i \sigma_i^2}
  $$
- **Where:**
  - $D=\frac{B}{Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$ for estimating means.
  - $D=\frac{B}{N \cdot Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$ for estimating totals.
:::

## Practical Considerations {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Decision Points:**
  1. Determining total sample size $n$ based on budget and desired precision.
  2. Choosing an allocation strategy based on known stratum characteristics and costs.
- **Common Errors:** Misestimating $N_i$, $\sigma_i$, or $c_i$ can lead to inefficient allocations.
- **Summary:** Effective sample size selection in stratified sampling crucially depends on accurate stratum characterization and cost considerations.
- **Further Steps:** Implementation of chosen sampling strategy and subsequent data collection.

> Example 1: The advertising firm in Example 1 of Day 13 finds that obtaining an observation from a rural household costs more than obtaining a response in town A or B . The increase is due to the costs of traveling from one rural household to another. The cost per observation in each town is estimated to be $\$ 9$ (i.e., $c_1=c_2=9$ ), and the costs per observation in the rural area to be $\$ 16$ (i.e., $c_3=16$ ). The stratum standard deviations (approximated by the strata sample variances from a prior survey) are $\sigma_1 \approx 5, \sigma_2 \approx 15$, and $\sigma_3 \approx 10$. Find the overall sample size $n$ and the stratum sample sizes, $n_1, n_2$, and $n_3$, that allow the firm to estimate, at minimum cost, the average television-viewing time with a bound on the error of estimation equal to 2 hours. (Recall that $N=310, N_1=155, N_2=62, N_3=93$)
