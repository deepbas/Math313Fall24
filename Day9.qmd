## Overview of Population Proportion Estimation

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Framework**: Observations in a sample are indicators ($Y_i$) representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of a characteristic.
- **Mathematical Basis**: $Y_i$ follows a Binomial distribution, useful in estimating proportions where outcomes are binary.
- **Calculation**: The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is computed as $\hat{p} = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum Y_i$, where $n$ is the sample size.

## Political Campaign Analysis

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Objective**: Estimate the proportion of voters supporting a new policy.
- **Survey**: Randomly sample 1,500 voters; $Y_i=1$ if a voter supports, and 0 otherwise.
- **Statistical Relevance**: Results direct strategic decisions and policy development with precision due to the binary nature of survey responses.

## Market Share Estimation

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Scenario**: Determining the market share of a new product in a competitive beverage market.
- **Approach**: Survey 2,000 consumers, with $Y_i=1$ if they prefer the new product.
- **Outcome**: Enables businesses to infer market share and adjust strategies based on the proportion $\hat{p}$, reflecting consumer preferences.

## Educational Research

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Study Goal**: Assess the integration rate of digital tools in classrooms.
- **Data Collection**: A survey of 350 schools, where $Y_i=1$ indicates digital tool adoption.
- **Implications**: Estimating $\hat{p}$ assists in evaluating the effectiveness of tech policies and funding allocations in education.

## Environmental Conservation Efforts

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Focus**: Measure public support for new environmental conservation laws.
- **Methodology**: Conduct a survey where each response $Y_i=1$ if the individual supports conservation efforts.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizing the binomial model to estimate $p$, the proportion of the population favoring conservation, guiding legislative and community actions.

## Bernoulli Distribution: Estimation

::: cle4
::: font80

- **Binary Data**: $Y_i = 1$ for responses in the category; $0$ otherwise.
- **Total Responses**: $\sum Y_i$ counts responses in the category.
- **Proportion Estimate**: 
  - $\hat{p} = \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum Y_i$, the sample proportion.
- **Bernoulli Distribution**: $Y_i$ follows with success $p$.
- **Variance**: $\sigma^2 = pq$ where $q = 1 - p$.

## Estimation of Population Proportion

::: cle4
::: font70

- **Estimator for Proportion $p$**:
  - $\hat{p}=\bar{y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$
- **Variance of Estimator $\hat{p}$**:
  - $\hat{V}(\hat{p})=\left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right)\cdot\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n-1}$
  - Using $n-1$ provides an unbiased estimator.
- **Error Bound on Estimation**:
  - $B_{\hat{p}}=t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}\cdot\sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{p})}$
  - Represents the $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\hat{p}$.

> Example 1: A simple random sample of $n=200$ college seniors was selected to estimate the proportion of $N=1200$ seniors going on to graduate school. Suppose 37 of them indicated that he or she plans to attend graduate school. Using the sample data:



a. Estimate $p$, the proportion of seniors planing to attend graduate school.

b. Compute the $95 \%$ bounds on the error of estimation.

## Sample Size for Estimating $p$

::: cle4
::: font70

- **Sample Size with Known $\hat{p}$**:
  - $n=\frac{N \hat{p} \hat{q}}{(N-1)\left(\frac{B_{\hat{p}}}{Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}\right)^2+\hat{p} \hat{q}}$
  - Uses $\hat{p}$ from similar past surveys to minimize error bound $B_{\hat{p}}$.

- **Sample Size with Unknown $\hat{p}$**:
  - $n=\frac{N(0.5)(0.5)}{(N-1)\left(\frac{B_p}{Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}\right)^2+(0.5)(0.5)}$
  - Applies a conservative estimate, assuming $\hat{p}=0.5$, to ensure a robust sample size calculation.

> Example 2: Student government leaders at a college want to conduct a survey to determine the proportion of students who favor a proposed honor code. Because interviewing $N=2000$ students in a reasonable length of time is almost impossible, determine the sample size (numbers of students to be interviewed) needed to estimate $p$ with a $95 \%$ bound on the error of estimation $B=0.05$ for the following cases:


a. No prior information is available to estimate $p$

<br>
<br>
<br>

b. A similar survey performed in another college provides $\hat{p}=0.61$.

> Example 3:Suppose you are a public health researcher aiming to estimate the proportion of residents in a large city who are willing to participate in a new health program designed to improve community health outcomes. From previous smaller-scale studies conducted in similar demographic settings, you estimate that around 45% of the population is likely to participate ($\hat{p} = 0.45$). The city has a population of 100,000 residents ($N = 100,000$), and you want to design a survey that will provide a reliable estimate of the population proportion with a high level of confidence.

Calculate the minimum sample size required to estimate the population proportion with a margin of error ($B_{\hat{p}}$) of 5% at a 95% confidence level.
:::


<!--

Step 1: Calculate the necessary sample size. Given $\$ \backslash$ hat $\{p\}=0.45 \$$, we can compute $\$ \backslash$ hat $\{q\}=1$ \hat\{p\} = 0.55\$. The desired margin of error at the 95\% confidence level, where $\$ Z \_\{1-\backslash f r a c\{\backslash a l p h a\}$ $\{2\}\}=1.96 \$$ for $95 \%$ confidence:

B_{\hat{p}}=0.05 n=\frac{N \hat{p} \hat{q}}{(N-1)\left(\frac{B_{\hat{p}}}{Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}\right)^2+\hat{p} \hat{q}}

The calculated sample size needed to achieve a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level is 379.

Once the sample size is determined, simulate survey data assuming the estimated proportion is accurate, then compute the 95% confidence interval for the population proportion based on the sample data.

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(stats)

# Given values
p_hat <- 0.45
q_hat <- 1 - p_hat
N <- 100000
B_p <- 0.05
z <- qnorm(0.975)  # Z-value for 95% confidence

# Calculating sample size
n <- N * p_hat * q_hat / ((N - 1) * (B_p / z)^2 + p_hat * q_hat)
n <- ceiling(n)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Simulate survey data
survey_responses <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = p_hat)
sample_p_hat <- mean(survey_responses)
sample_q_hat <- 1 - sample_p_hat

# Calculate the standard error and confidence interval
standard_error <- sqrt(sample_p_hat * sample_q_hat / n)
confidence_interval <- c(sample_p_hat - z * standard_error, sample_p_hat + z * standard_error)

# Output results
list(sample_size = n, confidence_interval = confidence_interval)
```


Based on the simulated survey data, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of residents willing to participate in the health program is approximately (0.391, 0.491).
