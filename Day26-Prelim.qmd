## Overview of Systematic Sampling {.font80}

::: cle6

Systematic sampling simplifies the sampling process, especially when the population size $N$ is known:

- Choose $k \leq \frac{N}{n}$ to obtain approximately $n$ observations.
- For $k=150$ and $n=100$, exactly 100 observations are obtained.

**Key Point:** When $N$ is unknown, guessing $k$ can lead to an imbalanced sample, potentially requiring multiple sampling attempts.

## Estimation of Population Mean {.font80}

::: cle7

The population mean $\mu$ can be estimated from a systematic sample using the sample mean $\bar{y}_{\text{sy}}$:

$$
\hat{\mu} = \bar{y}_{\text{sy}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i}{n}
$$

**Variance Estimation:**
$$
\hat{V}(\bar{y}_{\text{sy}}) = \left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right) \frac{s^2}{n}
$$

This assumes the population is randomly ordered. The estimated variance matches that of simple random sampling under similar conditions.

## Variance Considerations in Systematic Sampling {.font70}

::: cle8

Systematic sampling can exhibit different variance properties based on the population structure:

- **Random Population:** $\rho \approx 0$, variance is similar to simple random sampling.
- **Ordered Population:** $\rho < 0$, potentially lower variance than simple random sampling.
- **Periodic Population:** $\rho > 0$, possibly higher variance due to repetitive patterns.

**Variance Formula:**
$$
V(\bar{y}_{\text{sy}}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (n-1) \rho]
$$

The correlation $\rho$ affects variance estimation significantly depending on the population's arrangement.

## Practical Implications and Applications{.font80}

::: cle9

Systematic sampling is advantageous for its ease of use, especially in environments where manual sampling is necessary. However, its effectiveness is contingent on the population's ordering:

- **Advantages:** Easier to implement and can be more informative per unit cost than simple random sampling.
- **Challenges:** The single-cluster approach complicates variance estimation, requiring careful consideration of the population's structure.

Applications range from industrial quality control to voter registration sampling.
