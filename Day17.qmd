## Introduction to Estimating Proportions {.font80}

::: cle15
- **Context:** Estimating proportions in a population is key for decisions in marketing, public health, and policy making.
- **Example:** Determining the proportion of voters favoring a particular policy, the proportion of households with internet access, or the percentage of people immunized in different regions.
:::

## Real-World Application {.font80}

::: cle13
- **Marketing:** A company may want to estimate the proportion of consumers who prefer a new product over existing ones. Stratified sampling can be used to ensure various demographics are represented.
- **Public Health:** Health officials estimate the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated by stratifying the population by age, location, and other relevant factors.
:::

## Objective of Sample Allocation {.font80}

::: cle13
- **Objective:** Minimize the variance of the estimator while controlling costs.
- **Factors Influencing Allocation:** 
  1. Population proportion in each stratum, $p_i$.
  2. Variability of the proportion, expressed as $p_i(1-p_i)$.
  3. Sampling cost per stratum, $c_i$.
:::

## Step 1: Determine Weights for Sample Sizes {.font70}

::: cle6
- **Weight Formula:**
  $$
  W_i=\frac{N_i \frac{\sqrt{p_i (1-p_i)}}{\sqrt{c_i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^L N_j \frac{\sqrt{p_j (1-p_j)}}{\sqrt{c_j}}}
  $$
- **Purpose:** Adjust sample sizes to optimize precision and cost.
:::

## Step 2: Calculate Total Sample Size {.font80}

::: cle12
- **Sample Size Formula:**
  $$
  n=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^L N_i^2 \frac{p_i (1-p_i)}{w_i}}{N^2 D^2 + \sum_{i=1}^L N_i p_i (1-p_i)}
  $$
- **Where:**
  - $D=\frac{B}{Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$, defining the precision level for confidence intervals.
:::

## Step 3: Data Collection {.font80}

<br>
<br>

::: cle11
- **Implementation:** Collect data according to the sample sizes and weights determined in Steps 1 and 2.
:::

## Step 4: Estimation of Population Proportion {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Estimator Formula:**
  $$
  \hat{p}_{st}=\frac{1}{N}(N_1\hat{p}_1 + N_2\hat{p}_2 + \cdots + N_L\hat{p}_L)
  $$
- **Variance of Estimator:**
  $$
  \hat{V}(\hat{p}_{st})=\frac{1}{N^2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^L N_i^2\left(1-\frac{n_i}{N_i}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\hat{p}_i(1-\hat{p}_i)}{n_i-1}\right)
  $$
:::

## Degrees of Freedom for Variance Estimation {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Degrees of Freedom Formula:**
  $$
  df=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^L a_i p_i(1-p_i)\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^L \frac{(a_i p_i(1-p_i))^2}{n_i-1}}
  $$
- **Importance:** Correct degrees of freedom are crucial for accurate inference and confidence interval construction.

## Example 1 {.font60}

::: blockquote

An advertising firm wants to estimate the proportion of households viewing TV show X in a county. The county is divided into three strata: town A, town B, and the rural area, containing $N_1=155$, $N_2=62$, and $N_3=93$ households, respectively. From a study conducted three years ago, the previous estimates of proportions were $\hat{p}_1^*=0.80$, $\hat{p}_2^*=0.25$, and $\hat{p}_3^*=0.50$ (these values are used for selecting sample sizes, not as the current proportions).

**Costs:** The costs of obtaining an observation are $c_1=c_2=9$, $c_3=16$.

a. The firm aims to estimate the population proportion $p$ with a 95% bound on the error of estimation equal to 0.1. The task is to find the total sample size $n$ and the strata sample sizes $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$ that will achieve the desired bound at minimum cost.

b. Based on the new survey performed with the determined sample sizes, the new sample proportions are $\hat{p}_1=0.78$, $\hat{p}_2=0.35$, $\hat{p}_3=0.52$. Estimate the proportion of households viewing TV show X with a 95% bound on the error of estimation.
