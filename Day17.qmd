## Introduction to Estimating Proportions {.font80}

::: cle15

- Review of previous sampling methods: Simple Random and Stratified Sampling
- Introduction to new methods based on relationships between variables:
  - Ratio
  - Regression
  - Difference
- Focus on **Ratio Estimation** using a practical example
:::


## Why Use Ratio Estimation? {.font80}

::: cle14

- **Efficiency**: Improves the estimation of population totals using subsidiary information
- **Cost-effective**: Reduces the need for exhaustive data collection
- **Applications**: Useful in many fields such as agriculture, economics, and market research
:::

## Case Study: Estimating Sugar Content in Oranges {.font80}


::: cle12

- **Objective**: Estimate total sugar content of an orange shipment
- **Challenge**: Direct measurement is time-consuming and costly
:::

## Relationship Between Variables {.font80}


::: cle11

- **Observed Relationship**: Sugar content ($y$) is closely related to the weight ($x$) of oranges
- **Utilization**:
  - Use weight as a subsidiary variable to estimate sugar content
  - Avoids the need to count total number of oranges ($N$)
:::
 
## Mathematical Basis of Ratio Estimation {.font80}


::: cle6

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Given:} & \quad \frac{\mu_y}{\mu_x} = \frac{N \mu_y}{N \mu_x} = \frac{\tau_y}{\tau_x} \\
\text{Implication:} & \quad \tau_y = \frac{\mu_y}{\mu_x} \cdot \tau_x \\
\end{align*}
$$

- **$\mu_y$ and $\mu_x$**: Mean sugar content and mean weight per orange, respectively
- **$\tau_y$ and $\tau_x$**: Total sugar content and total weight, respectively
:::

## Estimation Procedure {.font80}


::: cle7

- **Sample** $n$ oranges and measure:
  - Sugar content $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$
  - Weight $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
- **Calculate Sample Means**:
  - $\bar{y}$ for sugar content
  - $\bar{x}$ for weight

$$
\text{Ratio Estimator:} \quad \hat{R} = \frac{\bar{y}}{\bar{x}}
$$
:::

## Advantages of Ratio Estimation {.font80}


::: cle12

- **Precision**: More precise estimates when $x$ and $y$ are correlated
- **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to various types of data and study designs
- **Scalability**: Effective for large datasets
:::

## Conclusion {.font80}


::: cle10

- Ratio estimation leverages relationships between variables to enhance statistical efficiency and reduce costs.
- Essential tool for researchers dealing with correlated variables in large populations.

> Example 1: A consumer survey was conducted to determine the ratio of the money spent on food to the total income per year for households in a small community. A simple random sample of 14 households was selected from 150 in the community. Sample data are given in the accompanying table. How to estimate the population ratio, $R$ ?

> Example 2: An advertising firm is concerned about the effect of a new regional promotional campaign on the total dollar sales for a particular product. A simple random sample of $n=20$ stores is drawn from the regional stores in which the product is sold. Quarterly sales data are obtained for the current three-month period and the three-month period prior to the new campaign. How to estimate the change?
