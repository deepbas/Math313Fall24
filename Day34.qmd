## Direct Sampling {.font70}

::: bql
::: row
::: left

1. **Initial Capture**
   - Capture a random sample of the population.
   - Sample size = $t$.
   - Tag each animal in the sample.
   - Release all tagged animals back into the population.
:::


::: right

2. **Second Capture**
   - After a time period, capture a second random sample.
   - Sample size = $n$.
   - Count the number of tagged animals in the second sample.
   - Number of tagged animals = $S$.
:::
:::
:::


## Estimator of the Population Size $N$ {.font80}

::: cle12
Involves tagging and later recapturing animals to estimate total population. The formula used is:

$$
\hat{N} = \frac{n t}{s}
$$
- Where:

  - $n$ is the size of the second sample,
  - $t$ is the size of the first sample,
  - $s$ is the number of tagged animals found in the second sample.

:::




## Estimated Variance of $\hat{N}$ {.font80}

::: cle14

- The estimated variance of $\hat{N}$ is given by:

$$
\hat{V}(\hat{N})=\frac{t^2 n(n-s)}{s^3}
$$

- $(1-\alpha)\%$ Conservative Critical Value using the $VP$ Inequality:

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{4}{9 \alpha}}
$$

:::

## Conservative $(1-\alpha)\%$ Confidence Interval {.font80}

::: cle7

- Conservative $(1-\alpha)\%$ Bound on Error of Estimation:

$$
B=\lambda \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{N})}
$$

- Conservative $(1-\alpha)\%$ Confidence Interval:

$$
\hat{N} \pm B
$$

> Example 1: Before posting a schedule for the upcoming hunting season, the game commission for a particular county wishes to estimate the size of the deer population. A random sample of 300 deer is captured $(t=300)$. The deer are tagged and released. A second sample of 200 is taken two weeks later ($\mathrm{n}=200$). If 62 tagged deer are recaptured in the second sample $(s=62)$, estimate $N$ using direct sampling without Chapman, with $95 \%$ conservative bound and confidence interval.

## Issue of Bias in $\hat{N}$ {.font70}

::: cle7
- Although $\hat{N}$ is a very natural estimator, it is biased. The expected value of $\hat{N}$ is given by:

\begin{align*}
E(\hat{N}) = N + \frac{N(N-t)}{nt} \neq N
\end{align*}

- When both $n$ and $t$ are large, the term $\frac{N(N-t)}{nt}$ becomes small enough to be negligible. This reduces the bias of $\hat{N}$.

- However, in many practical situations, it is challenging to obtain large enough samples to ignore this bias effectively. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting the estimates from smaller samples.

:::


## Chapman's Estimator for Population Size {.font60}

::: bql
::: row
::: left

Chapman's Estimator ($\hat{N}_C$)

- Less biased estimator using direct sampling:
$$
\hat{N}_C = \frac{(t+1)(n+1)}{s+1} - 1
$$

- Variables:
  - $t$: size of the initial sample,
  - $n$: size of the second sample,
  - $s$: tagged animals found in second sample.

:::

::: right

Variance and Confidence Intervals

- Estimated Variance:
$$
\hat{V}(\hat{N}_C) = \frac{(t+1)(n+1)(t-s)(n-s)}{(s+1)^2(s+2)}
$$

- Confidence Interval:
$$
\hat{N}_C \pm B_c
$$
Where $B_c = \lambda \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\hat{N}_C)}$,
$$
\lambda = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9 \alpha}}
$$
