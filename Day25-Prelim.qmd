## Introduction to Systematic Sampling {.font80}

::: cle6

Systematic sampling simplifies the sample selection process, making it a widely used design in survey sampling due to:

- Ease of implementation in the field.
- Lower susceptibility to selection errors compared to simple random and stratified random sampling.

**Definition:** A 1-in-k systematic sample with a random start is obtained by randomly selecting one element from the first $k$ elements and every $k^{th}$ element thereafter.

## Advantages and Problems of Systematic Sampling {.font70}

::: cle7

**Advantages:**

- Simplicity, especially useful with manual frames or registers.
- High intra-sample variability can make it more accurate than simple random sampling (SRS).

**Problems:**

- Cycled behavior in the sampling frame may bias the results.
- It is challenging to estimate unbiased sampling errors due to the dependency on a single starting point.


Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for effective use of systematic sampling in practice.

## How to Draw a Systematic Sample {.font80}

::: cle8

To draw a systematic sample:

- Choose $k$ such that $k \leq \frac{N}{n}$ where $N$ is the population size and $n$ is the desired sample size.
- Randomly select one element from the first $k$ elements.
- Continue selecting every $k^{th}$ element thereafter.

**Example:** For $N=15000$ and $n=1600$, choose $k=9$ for a 1-in-9 systematic sample.

## Understanding Sampling Probabilities in Systematic Sampling {.font80}

::: cle5

In systematic sampling:

- Each unit's selection probability, $\pi_k$, is $\frac{1}{a} = \frac{n}{N}$ when $N$ is a multiple of $a$.
- Issues arise when there are extra units beyond $a \times n$, leading to slight imbalances in probabilities.

**Key Point:** The entire sample can be considered as a single cluster, which complicates variance estimation as many second-order inclusion probabilities are zero.

:::

## Practical Considerations in Systematic Sampling {.font80}

::: cle8

While systematic sampling offers many advantages, its effectiveness depends on:

- The order of the sampling units.
- The randomness of the starting point.

The spread of the sample through the population should ideally cover the entire range to ensure representative data collection.

:::

## Applications of Systematic Sampling {.font80}

::: cle8

Systematic sampling's methodology allows for diverse applications, from national censuses to quality control in manufacturing:

- Ensures consistent coverage across a population.
- Facilitates easier and less error-prone data collection in field settings.

This versatility makes it a favored choice in many large-scale and long-term studies.

:::


## Handling Non-Integer $\frac{N}{n}$ in Systematic Sampling {.font70}

::: cle4

When $\frac{N}{n}$ is not an integer ($N = na + c$):

- If the starting value $r \leq c$, the sample includes $n+1$ units.
- Otherwise, the sample includes $n$ units.

**Alternative Method:**

1. Generate a random number $\varepsilon$ from a uniform distribution over $(0, a)$.
2. Select elements $i$ such that $i-1 < \varepsilon + (j-1)a \leq i$; for $j = 1, \ldots, n$ and $i = 1, \ldots, N$.

This method ensures each element has an equal chance of selection, regardless of the frame's total size relative to $n$.
