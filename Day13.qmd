## Recap: Stratified Sampling {.font80}

::: cle13


- **Objective**: Leverage stratified random sampling to estimate population characteristics more accurately.
- **Approach**: Divide population into homogeneous groups (strata) to reduce sampling error.
- **Application**: Widely used in surveys and research where population subgroups are to be measured with greater precision.


:::

## Stratification Explained {.font70}

::: cle12

- **Strata**: $L$ distinct groups within the population, each representing key sub-populations.
- **Sizes**:
  - Total population: $N = \sum_{i=1}^L N_i$
  - Each stratum: $N_i$ (sub-population size), $n_i$ (sample size)
- **Metrics**:
  - Sample mean for stratum $i$: $\bar{Y}_i$
  - Total for stratum $i$: $\tau_i$
  - Population total: $\tau = \sum_{i=1}^L \tau_i$

## Estimation Methodology {.font80}

<br>

::: cle8
- **Population Mean**: $\bar{y}_{st} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^L N_i \bar{Y}_i$, a weighted average where weights are proportional to stratum size.
- **Population Total**: $\hat{\tau}_{st} = N \cdot \bar{y}_{st}$, scaled up mean to reflect total population size.

:::

## Variance and Precision {.font80}

::: cle14
- **Key Concept**: Estimating variance helps assess the precision and reliability of our estimates.
- **Variance of Mean Estimation**:
  $$\hat{V}(\bar{y}_{st}) = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^L N_i^2 \left(1 - \frac{n_i}{N_i}\right) \frac{s_i^2}{n_i}$$
- **Variance of Total Estimation**:
  $$\hat{V}(\hat{\tau}_{st}) = N^2 \cdot \hat{V}(\bar{y}_{st})$$
:::

## Degree of Freedom and Critical Values {.font80}

::: cle9
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Crucial for determining the appropriate $t$ critical value when constructing confidence intervals.
  $$df = \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^L a_i s_i^2\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^L \frac{(a_i s_i^2)^2}{n_i-1}}$$
- **Factor**: $a_i = \frac{N_i(N_i-n_i)}{n_i}$ represents the adjusted sample size contributing to variance calculation.


:::

## Error Bounds and Confidence Intervals {.font80}

::: cle9
- **Error Bound**:
  $$B = t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, df} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{V}(\bar{y}_{st})}$$
- **Confidence Interval**:
  $$\text{Estimator} \pm B$$
  Provides a range within which we can be $(1-\alpha) \times 100\%$ confident that the population parameter lies.
:::

## Practical Implications {.font80}

::: cle14
- **Use Case**: Stratified sampling is ideal when certain strata are expected to differ significantly, and each requires individual analysis.
- **Advantage**: Increases efficiency and reduces costs by focusing resources on strategically sampled subgroups.
- **Limitation**: Requires detailed advance knowledge of the population structure, which may not always be available.

> Example 1: In a continuation of Example 1 from Day 12, imagine an advertising firm conducting a survey to measure weekly television-viewing habits across different locales. The firm, equipped with sufficient resources, opts to collect random samples of households from town A, town B, and a rural area. Details regarding the sample sizes will be addressed subsequently. Each selected household is surveyed to record their television-viewing hours per week, and the collected data is summarized in a table. Using this data, the task is to calculate both the average and total weekly television-viewing hours for households throughout the entire county and to establish an error bound for these estimates.
