- **Normal to Standard Normal Transformation**
  - For a variable $X \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\text{mean} = a, \text{SD} = b)$:
  - Standardization: $Z = \frac{X-a}{b}$
  - Results in $Z \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\text{mean} = 0, \text{SD} = 1)$, the standard normal distribution.

## Calculating Probabilities for a Normal Variable

::: cle
::: font70

For a normal random variable $X$, and a specific value $c$, the probability that $X$ exceeds $c$ can be transformed to a standard normal variable $Z$. This transformation simplifies the calculation as follows:

$$
P(X > c) = P(X-a > c-a) = P\left(\frac{X-a}{b} > \frac{c-a}{b}\right)$$
$$\qquad = P\left(Z > \frac{c-a}{b}\right) = 1 - P\left(Z < \frac{c-a}{b}\right)$$

This step highlights the utility of standardization in statistical analysis, turning complex normal calculations into simpler standard normal calculations.

## Calculating Interval Probabilities

<br>

::: cle5
::: font60

Determining the probability that $X$ lies between two values $c$ and $d$ involves subtracting the probability of $X$ being less than $c$ from the probability of $X$ being less than $d$:

$$
P(c < X < d) = P(X < d) - P(X < c) = P\left(Z < \frac{d-a}{b}\right) - P\left(Z < \frac{c-a}{b}\right)
$$

When $X = \bar{y}$, representing the mean of a sample, and with $a = \mu$ and $b = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, this formulation directly supports the creation of confidence intervals around the sample mean.

## Estimating the Population Mean

::: cle4
::: font70

When estimating the population mean $\mu$, which is unknown, we use the sample mean $\bar{y}$. The difference $|\bar{y} - \mu|$ represents the error of our estimation.

### Error Bound for Confidence

To ensure the reliability of our estimate, we define a bound $B$ such that:

$$
P(|\bar{y} - \mu| \leqslant B) \geqslant 1 - \alpha
$$

This bound indicates that the true population mean is likely within $B$ units of our sample mean with a confidence level of $1 - \alpha$. The smaller the error, the closer our sample mean is to the true population mean, enhancing the estimation's accuracy.

## Standardizing and Solving for $B$

::: cle4
::: font60

Transforming our problem using the standard deviation of the sample mean, we standardize:

$$P(-B\leqslant \bar{y}-\mu\leqslant B)=P\left(\frac{-B}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\leqslant \frac{\bar{y}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\leqslant \frac{B}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right)\geqslant 1-\alpha$$

Leveraging the symmetry of the standard normal distribution gives us:

$$\frac{B}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$$

Concluding with the critical value for $B$:

$$B=z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

This calculation shows how $B$ scales with both the sample size $n$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$, key to interpreting the confidence in our estimate.

## Using $t$-Distribution

::: cle4
::: font60

When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation $s$ and the $t$-distribution to standardize the problem:

$$P(-B\leqslant \bar{y}-\mu\leqslant B)=P\left(\frac{-B}{s/\sqrt{n}}\leqslant \frac{\bar{y}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}\leqslant \frac{B}{s/\sqrt{n}}\right)\geqslant 1-\alpha$$

Leveraging the properties of the $t$-distribution, given the degrees of freedom $n-1$, we find:

$$\frac{B}{s/\sqrt{n}}=t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}$$

Concluding with the critical value for $B$:

$$B=t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}\cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

This calculation shows how $B$ scales with the sample size $n$ and the sample standard deviation $s$, crucial for interpreting the confidence in our estimate when $\sigma$ is unknown.

## Case Study

::: cle3
::: font70

In a standard math quiz for the public school system of a county, each student was graded on a four-point scale $(0,1,2,3), 3$ being a perfect score. The results for all students are given as follows:

\begin{array}{ll}
\hline \text { Score, y} & \text { Propotion, P(y) } \\
\hline 3 & 0.64 \\
2 & 0.16 \\
1 & 0.08 \\
0 & 0.12 \\
\hline
\end{array}

## Quiz


a. Compute the expected value of the quiz score.

<br>

b. Compute the standard deviation of the quiz score.

<br>

c. A sample of 100 students is randomly selected. What is the probability of this sample mean greater than 2.425 ?

## Solutions

<details> <summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
::: font60

a. $E(y)=\sum y \cdot P(y)=\mu =2.32$ 

b. $V(y)=\sum(y-\mu)^2 \cdot P(y)=\sigma^2=1.098$

$\operatorname{\operatorname {SD}}(y)=\sigma=\sqrt{1.098} \approx 1.048$

c. A sample of $n=100$ students is selected

\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
P(\bar{y}>2.425) & =P\left(z>\frac{2.425-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}\right) \\
& =P\left(z>\frac{2.425-2.32}{1.048 / \sqrt{100}}\right) \\
& \approx P(z>1)=1-P(z<1) \\
& =1-0.8413=0.1587 
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
