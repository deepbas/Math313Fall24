## Introduction to Population Estimation {.font80}

::: cle7
Exploring different methods to estimate population sizes in various contexts such as wildlife, events, and quality assurance.
:::

## Direct Sampling Method {.font80}

::: cle12
Involves tagging and later recapturing animals to estimate total population. The formula used is:
$$
\hat{N} = \frac{n \times t}{s}
$$
where $n$ is the size of the second sample, $t$ is the number of tagged animals, and $s$ is the number of tagged animals recaptured.
:::

## Inverse Sampling {.font80}

::: cle7
A variant of direct sampling that continues until a preset number of tagged animals are recaptured, with the population estimate given by the same formula as direct sampling.
:::

## Density Estimation Method {.font80}

::: cle12
Involves estimating animal density per unit area and multiplying by the total area to estimate population size:
$$
\hat{N} = \hat{\lambda} \times A
$$
where $\hat{\lambda}$ is the estimated density and $A$ is the area.
:::

## Adaptive Sampling {.font80}

::: cle7
Enhances density estimates by incorporating high-density clusters found during initial sampling, adapting the approach dynamically.
:::

## Example 1: Wildlife Conservation {.font60}

> A wildlife reserve estimates the population of a bird species using direct sampling. The first sample tags 300 birds, and a second sample of 200 birds recaptures 62 tagged individuals.

## Example 2: Event Attendance Estimation {.font60}

> An event organizer uses adaptive sampling to estimate the number of attendees in various sections of a venue, initially counting in a smaller focused area and adjusting based on crowd density.
